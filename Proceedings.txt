Since the target organism is a plant, a suitable agrobacterium plasmid, pCAMBIA2300 was chosen.

Restriction site HinDIII was chosen, simply because it's a single cut restriction site and one I am familiar with.

A CaMV promoter was added from the pP35S plasmid, although the in-built promoter could have been utilized to reduce the number of base pairs.

Genes AT1G1260.1 (aka DDF1) and AT4G161101.1 (aka RR2) were added to decrease auxins and increase gibberellins respectively.

Self cleaving peptide P2A was added from pC5Kan-P2A plasmid. P2A was added between the DDF1 and RR2 genes.

Stop codon sequence TAA,TGA and TAG were added after the RR2 gene.

CaMV Poly A Signal was added from pICH41414 plasmid to terminate the gene sequence.

For selection of functional mutants, Kanamycin resistance genes are present on the plasmid.
